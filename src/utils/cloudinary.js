/**
 * COMPREHENSIVE EXPLANATION OF THE BUGS AND FIXES:
 * 
 * 1. MAIN BUG: The original code only attempted to delete files in the error handler,
 *    not after successful uploads. This caused files to accumulate in the temp directory.
 * 
 * 2. POTENTIAL ISSUES WITH AVATAR VS COVER IMAGE:
 *    - If only cover images were being deleted but not avatars, this could be because:
 *      a) There might be path discrepancies between how avatar and cover image paths are constructed
 *      b) The avatar upload might be happening in a different flow or callback
 *      c) File permission issues for specific file types
 * 
 * 3. ERROR HANDLING IMPROVEMENTS:
 *    - Added separate try/catch blocks for deletion to prevent deletion errors from affecting upload results
 *    - Added more logging to trace exactly what's happening with each file
 *    - Added existence checks before all file operations to prevent errors
 * 
 * 4. CODE ROBUSTNESS:
 *    - Better logging to make debugging easier
 *    - More defensive programming with existence checks
 *    - Separation of concerns between upload and cleanup operations
